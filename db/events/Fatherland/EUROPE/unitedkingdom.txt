However, as the war progressed, the British began to win several key battles, such as El Alamein. When the Germans were pushed out of Africa, a great surge of morale struck the nation. While we could not win the war, we at least survived. Once an armistice was signed, the people sighed of relief. In the years following, the empire began to fall apart though." #When India gained it's independence, other colonial provinces began to rebel. In Africa, insurgency groups are fighting against our troops. In Britain, fascists with the support of Germany, are gaining more of a presence every day. With the looming threat of a third world war, this certainly does not help. We shall wait and see however."
